      <p>
        In software development, cross-cutting concerns are functions or
        features that are relevant to multiple parts of an application. In the
        context of React, cross-cutting concerns might include things like
        authentication, logging, error handling, or performance monitoring.
        These concerns often involve logic that is relevant to many different
        components in a React application, and therefore need to be implemented
        in a way that is modular and easy to reuse. One way to address
        cross-cutting concerns in React is to use higher-order components, which
        are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new,
        enhanced component that has the desired behavior. Higher-order
        components can be used to wrap individual components or groups of
        components, making it easy to apply cross-cutting concerns consistently
        throughout an application.

        Another simpler example is when you need to pass an argument to a custom
        hook that cannot be passed directly, so you wrap the custom hook in a
        higher-order component and pass the argument to the higher-order
        component.
