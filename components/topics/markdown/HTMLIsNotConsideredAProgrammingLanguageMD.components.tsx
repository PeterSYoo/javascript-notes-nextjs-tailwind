      <p>
        HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is not considered a programming
        language because it does not have the ability to create logic or perform
        complex operations like a traditional programming language does.
        Instead, HTML is used to structure and format the content of a webpage,
        and it consists of a set of tags and attributes that define the layout
        and appearance of the page. While it is used in conjunction with
        programming languages like JavaScript and CSS to create dynamic and
        interactive websites, HTML itself is not a programming language and
        cannot be used to create standalone programs.
