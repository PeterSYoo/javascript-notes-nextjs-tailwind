      <p>
        The process of generating HTML from a DOM is similar in both server-side
        rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR). In both cases, the
        application creates a virtual representation of the web page in the form
        of a Document Object Model (DOM), and then generates the HTML for the
        page by iterating through the nodes of the DOM and generating the
        corresponding HTML elements for each node.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there are some key differences between SSR and CSR in terms of
        when and where this process occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In SSR, the process of generating the HTML for the page occurs on the
        server, before the HTML is sent to the client. This means that the
        client receives a fully-rendered HTML page, which it can display to the
        user without having to execute any additional JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CSR, the process of generating the HTML for the page occurs in the
        client&apos;s web browser, after the page has been loaded and the
        JavaScript application has been executed. This means that the client
        receives an initial HTML page that includes a placeholder for the
        dynamic content that will be generated by the JavaScript application.
        When the JavaScript application is executed, it creates the DOM and
        generates the HTML for the page, which is then inserted into the
        placeholder in the initial HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, while the process of generating HTML from a DOM is similar in both
        SSR and CSR, the timing and context in which this process occurs is
        different.
