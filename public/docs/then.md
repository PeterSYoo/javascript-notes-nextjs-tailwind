_"In JavaScript, the .then() method is used to specify what action should be taken when a promise is fulfilled, either by returning a value or throwing an error. It is usually called on the returned value of a promise's .resolve() method."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are in a restaurant, waiting to be served your meal. You place your order with the server, and then you can sit back and relax while you wait for the kitchen to prepare your food.

<br/>
In the same way, the .then() method in JavaScript allows you to specify a set of actions or tasks that should be performed after a certain event has completed. When you call the .then() method, you are essentially "ordering" a set of actions to be performed, and then you can let the program continue running while those actions are carried out in the background.

<br/>
Just as the server brings your food to you when it is ready, the .then() method allows you to specify a set of actions that should be performed when a certain event is completed. And just as you can enjoy your meal while the server takes care of the rest, you can let the program continue running while the .then() method takes care of the specified actions.

<br/>
Overall, the .then() method in JavaScript allows you to specify a set of actions that should be performed after a certain event has completed, in a way that is similar to placing an order at a restaurant and then waiting for your food to be served.

<br/>
The .then() method is used to specify what should happen after a promise is fulfilled. A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. When you make an async function call, the function returns a promise that the task will be completed. You can use the .then() method to specify what should happen when the promise is fulfilled, or in other words, when the async operation is completed successfully.

<br/>
Async/await is a syntax that makes it easier to work with promises and async function calls. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code. When you use async/await, you can "wait" for a promise to be fulfilled using the "await" keyword, instead of using the .then() method.

<br/>
For example, consider the following code that uses the .then() method to handle an async function call:

<Code language='javascript'>

asyncFunction()
&nbsp;.then((result) => {
&nbsp;&nbsp;// do something with the result
&nbsp;})
&nbsp;.catch((error) => {
&nbsp;&nbsp;// handle the error
&nbsp;});
</Code>

Here's the same code using async/await:

<Code language='javascript'>

try {
&nbsp;const result = await asyncFunction();
&nbsp;// do something with the result
} catch (error) {
&nbsp;// handle the error
}
</Code>

As you can see, the async/await syntax makes it easier to work with async function calls and promises, because it allows you to write asynchronous code using familiar control flow statements like "try" and "catch". However, both the .then() method and async/await are useful tools for handling asynchronous code in JavaScript, and they can be used together as needed.
