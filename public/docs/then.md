_"In JavaScript, the .then() method is used to specify what action should be taken when a promise is fulfilled, either by returning a value or throwing an error. It is usually called on the returned value of a promise's .resolve() method."_

<br/>
An analogy for the .then() method might be making a purchase online and specifying what should happen after the purchase is complete. When you make a purchase online, you typically have to wait for the payment to be processed and the order to be fulfilled. You can use the .then() method (or a similar function) to specify what should happen after the purchase is complete. For example, you might specify that you want to receive a confirmation email, or that you want the item to be shipped to a certain address. In this way, the .then() method allows you to specify what should happen "then", or after, the promise (purchase) is fulfilled.

<br/>
The .then() method is used to specify what should happen after a promise is fulfilled. A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. When you make an async function call, the function returns a promise that the task will be completed. You can use the .then() method to specify what should happen when the promise is fulfilled, or in other words, when the async operation is completed successfully.

<br/>
Async/await is a syntax that makes it easier to work with promises and async function calls. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code. When you use async/await, you can "wait" for a promise to be fulfilled using the "await" keyword, instead of using the .then() method.

<br/>
For example, consider the following code that uses the .then() method to handle an async function call:

<Code language='javascript'>

asyncFunction()
&nbsp;.then((result) => {
&nbsp;&nbsp;// do something with the result
&nbsp;})
&nbsp;.catch((error) => {
&nbsp;&nbsp;// handle the error
&nbsp;});
</Code>

Here's the same code using async/await:

<Code language='javascript'>

try {
&nbsp;const result = await asyncFunction();
&nbsp;// do something with the result
} catch (error) {
&nbsp;// handle the error
}
</Code>

As you can see, the async/await syntax makes it easier to work with async function calls and promises, because it allows you to write asynchronous code using familiar control flow statements like "try" and "catch". However, both the .then() method and async/await are useful tools for handling asynchronous code in JavaScript, and they can be used together as needed.
