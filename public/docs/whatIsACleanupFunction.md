_"A cleanup function in React is a function that is called before the component is re-rendered or unmounted, and is used to perform any necessary cleanup, such as cancelling network requests or removing event listeners."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are hosting a party in a rented event space. You have invited a DJ to play music and have set up a table with snacks and drinks for your guests. As the party goes on, your guests consume the snacks and drinks and leave behind empty cups and plates. If you do not clean up these items, the table will become cluttered and the event space will become messy.

<br/>
In the same way, when you use resources in a React application, such as network connections or event listeners, you need to release these resources when they are no longer needed. Otherwise, they can continue to consume memory and cause memory leaks, just like the empty cups and plates can clutter the table.

<br/>
To prevent memory leaks, you can use a cleanup function in React to release resources when they are no longer needed. This is similar to cleaning up the event space after the party by throwing away the trash and putting away any decorations. Just like you would tidy up the event space before leaving, the cleanup function is used to perform any necessary cleanup before the component is no longer needed.

<br/>
Here is an example of how you can use a cleanup function in a React component to unsubscribe from an event and prevent a memory leak:

```

  import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

  function MyComponent(props) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = someAPI.subscribe();

    // Cleanup function
    return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
    };
  });

  return ,[object Object],;
  }

```

<br/>
In this example, the useEffect Hook is called after the component is rendered and is used to subscribe to an event using someAPI. The cleanup function is returned from the useEffect Hook and is called before the component is re-rendered or unmounted. It is used to unsubscribe from the event by calling unsubscribe() on the subscription object. This releases the resources and prevents them from causing memory leaks, just like cleaning up the event space after the party prevents it from becoming cluttered and messy.
