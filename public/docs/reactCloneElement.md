_"React.cloneElement is a function that creates a new element that is a copy of an existing element, with additional props merged in."_

<br/>
React.cloneElement is used to clone an existing element and pass it new props. It is often used when creating higher-order components, which are functions that accept a component and return a new component with added functionality. For example, a higher-order component might use React.cloneElement to add additional props to a wrapped component before rendering it.

Here is an example of using React.cloneElement to add a new prop to an element:

```

  import React from 'react';
  import { cloneElement } from 'react';

  function MyComponent(props) {
    const newElement = React.cloneElement(props.element, {
      newProp: 'value',
    });
    return <div>{newElement}</div>;
  }

```

In this example, the MyComponent function creates a new element that is a copy of the props.element element, with a new prop called newProp added. The new element is then rendered inside a `<div>`.
