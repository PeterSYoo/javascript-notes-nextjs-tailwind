_"Render props is a design pattern in React that allows a component to share its internal state and functionality with other components, by passing a function as a prop to be called by the child component."_

Imagine that you are a museum curator, and you are responsible for organizing and displaying a collection of artworks for the public. To help you manage your collection, you have a set of "catalogues" that you use to keep track of the artworks, and a set of "tools" that you use to hang, light, and label the artworks.

<br/>
As a curator, you have a set of "techniques" that you use to organize and display the artworks. For example, you might have a technique for grouping similar artworks together, or a technique for highlighting the key features of an artwork. These techniques are like "recipes" that you use to guide your work as a curator.

<br/>
In React, render props is a design pattern that is similar to the curator's techniques in that it allows a component to share its internal state and functionality with other components in a reusable way. Render props is a design pattern that allows a component to share its internal state and functionality with other components by passing a function as a prop to be called by the child component.

<br/>
For example, consider the following code written in React:

```

  import React from 'react';

  function MousePosition(props) {
    const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
    const handleMouseMove = event => setMousePosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
    return (
      <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>
        {props.render(mousePosition)}
      </div>
    );
  }

  function MousePositionDisplay(props) {
    return (
      <div>
        The mouse position is ({props.x}, {props.y}).
      </div>
    );
  }

  ReactDOM.render(
    <MousePosition render={mousePosition => <MousePositionDisplay {...mousePosition} />} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );

```

<br/>
In this code, the `MousePosition` component is defined using the render props design pattern. The `MousePosition` component has a state value called `mousePosition` that is updated whenever the mouse moves inside the `div` element. The `MousePosition` component also has a `handleMouseMove` function that is called whenever the mouse moves inside the `div` element, and updates the `mousePosition` state value.

<br/>
The `MousePosition` component passes a function called `props.render` as a prop to the `div` element, which is called with the `mousePosition` state value as an argument. The `MousePosition` component also passes the `mousePosition` state value to the `MousePositionDisplay` component as props.

<br/>
The `MousePositionDisplay` component is defined as a function that displays the current mouse position. The `MousePositionDisplay` component receives the `x` and `y` values of the mouse position as props, and displays them in the `div` element.

<br/>
Overall, render props is a design pattern in React that allows a component to share its internal state and functionality with other components, by passing a function as a prop to be called by the child component. It is a useful tool for sharing and organizing internal state and functionality in a reusable way.
