_"In React, side effects are actions that are performed when a component mounts or updates, such as making an HTTP request or setting up an event listener."_

Imagine that you are a mechanic responsible for maintaining a fleet of vehicles. To keep the vehicles in good working order, you perform regular maintenance tasks, such as changing the oil, rotating the tires, and replacing the brake pads.

<br/>
In this scenario, the maintenance tasks that you perform are "side effects." They are actions that are performed when a vehicle is serviced, but are not directly related to the main purpose of the vehicle (which is to transport people or goods).

<br/>
In React, side effects are similar to the maintenance tasks that you perform as a mechanic. They are actions that are performed when a component mounts or updates, but are not directly related to the main purpose of the component (which is to render UI). Examples of side effects in React include making an HTTP request, setting up an event listener, or updating the component's state.

<br/>
For example, consider the following code written in React:

```

  import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  function Example() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
      document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    });

    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
        <button
          onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

In this code, the useEffect hook is used to perform a side effect when the component mounts or updates. The side effect is setting the document title to reflect the number of times the button has been clicked.

<br/>
Overall, side effects in React are actions that are performed when a component mounts or updates, but are not directly related to the main purpose of the component. Examples of side effects include making an HTTP request, setting up an event listener, or updating the component's state.
