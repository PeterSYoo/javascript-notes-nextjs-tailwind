_"The scope chain is a series of lexical environments that are linked together and is used to determine the accessibility of variables and functions in JavaScript by allowing the JavaScript engine to search for variables and functions in the current and parent lexical environments."_

<br/>
The scope chain is a series of lexical environments that are linked together and is used to determine the accessibility of variables and functions in JavaScript. When you access a variable or function in your code, the JavaScript engine looks for the variable or function in the current lexical environment. If it is not found, the engine looks for it in the next lexical environment in the scope chain, and so on.

<br/>
Here's some code that illustrates the concept of the scope chain:

<Code language='javascript'>

let x = "global";

function foo() {
&nbsp;let y = "local";

&nbsp;console.log(x); // Output: "global"
&nbsp;console.log(y); // Output: "local"
}

foo();

console.log(x); // Output: "global"
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
</Code>

In this code, the global lexical environment contains a `let` variable `x` with the value "global". When the `foo` function is called, a new lexical environment is created for the function and is added to the top of the scope chain. This new lexical environment contains a `let` variable `y` with the value "local".

<br/>
When the `console.log` statements inside the `foo` function are executed, the JavaScript engine looks for the variables `x` and `y` in the current lexical environment (the one created for the `foo` function). Since `y` is found in this environment, its value "local" is printed to the console. Since `x` is not found in the current environment, the engine looks for it in the next lexical environment in the scope chain, which is the global lexical environment. In the global lexical environment, the variable `x` is found and its value "global" is printed to the console.

<br/>
When the `console.log` statements outside of the `foo` function are executed, the JavaScript engine looks for the variables `x` and `y` in the global lexical environment. Since `x` is found in this environment, its value "global" is printed to the console. Since `y` is not found in the global lexical environment, a `ReferenceError` is thrown.

<br/>
The scope chain is created when a function is called. When a function is called, a new lexical environment is created for the function and is added to the top of the scope chain. This new lexical environment contains the arguments and variables that are local to the function.

<br/>
The scope chain is used to resolve variable and function references. When you access a variable or function in your code, the JavaScript engine looks up the reference in the scope chain to find the corresponding variable or function.

<br/>
The scope chain can have multiple levels. When a function is called inside another function, a new lexical environment is created and added to the top of the scope chain. This means that the scope chain can have multiple levels, with the innermost lexical environment at the top of the chain and the global lexical environment at the bottom.

<br/>
Understanding the scope chain is important because it helps you to understand how the JavaScript engine determines the accessibility of variables and functions in your code. It can also help you to avoid common pitfalls, such as trying to access a variable before it has been declared or accidentally overwriting a variable that you did not mean to change.
