- The app is loaded in the browser, and the root React component is rendered to the DOM.
  <br/>
- When the root component is rendered, it may also render other child components, depending on the logic in its render() function.
  <br/>
- If a child component needs to retrieve data or perform some logic, it can do so in its useEffect hook, which is a function that runs when the component is rendered or re-rendered.
  <br/>
- The useEffect hook can make HTTP requests or perform other side effects, and then update the component's state using the setState function.
  <br/>
- Once the component's state has been updated, the component will re-render, and the process repeats from step 2.
  <br/>
- As the component re-renders, it will update the DOM to reflect the changes in its state.

<br/>
This process continues as the user interacts with the app, triggering updates to the component state and re-renders as necessary.
