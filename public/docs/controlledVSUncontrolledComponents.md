_"In React, controlled components are form elements that are controlled by the state of the component, while uncontrolled components are form elements that are not controlled by the state of the component and maintain their own internal state."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are a manager at a warehouse, and you are responsible for keeping track of the inventory of different products. To do this, you have set up a system where each product has a corresponding barcode, and you use a barcode scanner to scan the barcodes of incoming and outgoing products.

<br/>
In this system, the barcode scanner is a controlled component, because it is controlled by the warehouse manager (you). You decide when to scan the barcodes and what information to input into the system.

<br/>
On the other hand, consider a scenario where you have set up a self-checkout kiosk for customers to use when making purchases. The kiosk has a screen where customers can input their payment information, such as their credit card number and expiration date. In this case, the input fields on the screen are uncontrolled components, because they are not controlled by the warehouse manager (you). The customers decide when to input their payment information and what information to input.

<br/>
In React, controlled components are form elements (such as input fields and text areas) that are controlled by the state of the component. The component manages the value of the form element, and the form element's value is determined by the component's state.

<br/>
On the other hand, uncontrolled components are form elements that are not controlled by the state of the component. The form element maintains its own internal state, and the component does not have direct control over the value of the form element.

<br/>
For example, consider the following code written in React:

<Code language='javascript'>

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Form() {
&nbsp;const [value, setValue] = useState('');

&nbsp;function handleChange(event) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;setValue(event.target.value);
&nbsp;}

&nbsp;return (
&nbsp;&nbsp;<form>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<label>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</label>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</form>
&nbsp;);
}
</Code>

In this code, the input field is a controlled component, because it is controlled by the state of the Form component. The value of the input field is determined by the value state variable, and the handleChange function is used to update the value state variable when the user types into the input field.

<br/>
On the other hand, consider the following code:

<Code language='javascript'>

import React from 'react';

function Form() {
&nbsp;return (
&nbsp;&nbsp;<form>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<label>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<input type="text" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</label>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</form>
&nbsp;);
}
</Code>

In this code, the input field is an uncontrolled component, because it is not controlled by the state of the Form component. The input field maintains its own internal state, and the Form component does not have direct control over the value
