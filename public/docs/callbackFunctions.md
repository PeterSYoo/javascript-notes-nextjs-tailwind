_"In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the outer function has completed, typically as a way to handle asynchrony."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are a customer at a store, and you want to purchase an item that is currently out of stock. The store clerk tells you that the item will be restocked the next day, and offers to call you when the item becomes available.

<br/>
In the same way, a callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and is called by that function when a certain event has occurred. When you pass a callback function to another function, you are essentially providing the function with a "phone number" (the callback function) to call when the event has completed.

<br/>
Just as the store clerk calls you when the item becomes available, the function calls the callback function when the event has occurred. And just as you can then come to the store to pick up the item, the callback function can execute code or perform actions in response to the event.

<br/>
Overall, callback functions in JavaScript allow you to specify a set of actions that should be performed after a certain event has occurred, in a way that is similar to providing a phone number to be called when an item becomes available at a store.

<br/>
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and is executed after some kind of event. For example, you might have a function that reads a file from the filesystem, and you want to specify a callback function to be executed when the file has been read. This is a common pattern in JavaScript, and is often used in conjunction with higher-order functions.

<br/>
Here is an example of a callback function being passed to the `setTimeout` function, which executes a function after a specified number of milliseconds:

<Code language='javascript'>

function greet() {
&nbsp;console.log('Hello, World!');
}

setTimeout(greet, 1000); // Outputs "Hello, World!" after 1 second
</Code>

In the example above, the `greet` function is the callback function. It is passed as an argument to the `setTimeout` function, and is executed after 1 second.

<br/>
Here is an example of using an arrow function as a callback function:

<Code language='javascript'>

[1, 2, 3].map((x) => x \* x); // Outputs [1, 4, 9]
</Code>

In the example above, the arrow function `(x) => x * x` is passed as a callback function to the `map` method. The `map` method calls the callback function for each element in the array, and returns a new array with the results.
