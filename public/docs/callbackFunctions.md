_"In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the outer function has completed, typically as a way to handle asynchrony."_

<br/>
Callback functions in JavaScript can be thought of as a friend who helps you with a task. Imagine that you are planning a surprise party for a friend and you need to buy some decorations and supplies. You don't have time to go shopping yourself, so you ask a friend to help you out. You give your friend a list of items to buy and a budget, and ask them to call you when they are finished shopping.

<br/>
In this scenario, your friend is acting as a callback function. You have given them a task (shopping for party supplies) and specified how they should notify you when the task is complete (by calling you). Your friend is "called back" to let you know that the task is finished.

<br/>
In the same way, a callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed at a later time, when the task that the callback is associated with is complete. The function that the callback is passed to is responsible for calling the callback function when the task is finished, just like your friend is responsible for calling you when the shopping is done.

<br/>
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and is executed after some kind of event. For example, you might have a function that reads a file from the filesystem, and you want to specify a callback function to be executed when the file has been read. This is a common pattern in JavaScript, and is often used in conjunction with higher-order functions.

<br/>
Here is an example of a callback function being passed to the `setTimeout` function, which executes a function after a specified number of milliseconds:

<Code language='javascript'>

function greet() {
&nbsp;console.log('Hello, World!');
}

setTimeout(greet, 1000); // Outputs "Hello, World!" after 1 second
</Code>

In the example above, the `greet` function is the callback function. It is passed as an argument to the `setTimeout` function, and is executed after 1 second.

<br/>
Here is an example of using an arrow function as a callback function:

<Code language='javascript'>

[1, 2, 3].map((x) => x \* x); // Outputs [1, 4, 9]
</Code>

In the example above, the arrow function `(x) => x * x` is passed as a callback function to the `map` method. The `map` method calls the callback function for each element in the array, and returns a new array with the results.
