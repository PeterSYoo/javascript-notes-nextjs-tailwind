- Updating the component's state: When a component's state is updated using the setState function, the component will re-render.

- Updating the component's props: If a component receives new props from its parent component, it will re-render.

- The component's parent component re-renders: If a component's parent component re-renders, the component will also re-render.
  <br/>
- A hook changes: If a component is using a hook that depends on a value that changes, the component will re-render.

It's important to note that React aims to minimize unnecessary re-renders, and will only re-render a component if it determines that the component's output has actually changed. This means that calling setState with the same state as the current state, or passing the same props to a component, will not cause it to re-render.
