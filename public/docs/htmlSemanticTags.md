HTML semantic tags are tags in HTML that provide meaning to the structure of web content. They are used to describe the type of content contained within an HTML element. Examples of semantic tags include the `<header>` tag, the `<nav>` tag, the `<article>` tag, and the `<footer>` tag.

<br/>
The main reason for using semantic tags is to make the structure of web content more meaningful to both users and search engines. By using semantic tags, developers can provide context for the content on a page, which makes it easier for users to understand and for search engines to index.

<br/>
For example, when a search engine crawls a page, it can use the semantic tags to understand the different sections of the page and their relationships to one another. This can help the search engine to better understand the content on the page and provide more relevant results to users.

<br/>
In addition to improving the search engine's understanding of the content, semantic tags also improve the accessibility of a website. Assistive technologies can use the semantic tags to understand the structure of the web page and provide appropriate navigation to users.

In summary, semantic tags make web content more meaningful to users and search engines, and make websites more accessible to people with disabilities by providing context and appropriate navigation.

Here is a list of some of the most commonly used HTML semantic tags:

<br/>
```

  <header>: Defines a header for a document or section.
  <nav>: Defines navigation links.
  <article>: Defines a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or forum post.
  <section>: Defines a section of a document, such as chapters, headings, or blocks of related content.
  <aside>: Defines content that is related to the main content, but not essential for understanding it.
  <figure>: Defines a container for content, such as images or diagrams, that can be referred to from the main content.
  <figcaption>: Defines a caption for a <figure> element.
  <footer>: Defines a footer for a document or section.
  <main>: Defines the main content of a document.
  <mark>: Defines marked/highlighted text.
  <time>: Defines a date/time.
  <address>: Defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document.
  
```

There are other semantic tags available in HTML5 such as `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<mark>`, `<time>`, `<address>`, `<dialog>` and `<details>` which are less widely used but still useful on certain cases. It's worth mentioning that there are also other semantic tags like `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` which could be used to provide more context to certain content, like images and diagrams, which are related to the main content but not essential for understanding it.
