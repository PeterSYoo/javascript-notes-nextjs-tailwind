The process of generating HTML from a DOM is similar in both server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR). In both cases, the application creates a virtual representation of the web page in the form of a Document Object Model (DOM), and then generates the HTML for the page by iterating through the nodes of the DOM and generating the corresponding HTML elements for each node.

However, there are some key differences between SSR and CSR in terms of when and where this process occurs.

<br/>
In SSR, the process of generating the HTML for the page occurs on the server, before the HTML is sent to the client. This means that the client receives a fully-rendered HTML page, which it can display to the user without having to execute any additional JavaScript.

<br/>
In CSR, the process of generating the HTML for the page occurs in the client's web browser, after the page has been loaded and the JavaScript application has been executed. This means that the client receives an initial HTML page that includes a placeholder for the dynamic content that will be generated by the JavaScript application. When the JavaScript application is executed, it creates the DOM and generates the HTML for the page, which is then inserted into the placeholder in the initial HTML.

<br/>
So, while the process of generating HTML from a DOM is similar in both SSR and CSR, the timing and context in which this process occurs is different.
