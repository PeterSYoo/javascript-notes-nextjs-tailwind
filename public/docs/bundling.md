_"Bundling in JavaScript refers to the process of combining multiple JavaScript files into a single file, or bundle, in order to reduce the number of HTTP requests that the browser has to make in order to load a web page."_

Bundling JavaScript files for a web browser is like packing multiple items into a single box for shipping. Just as you might want to send several items to someone in a single box in order to save on shipping costs and reduce the number of packages that have to be handled, you might want to combine multiple JavaScript files into a single bundle in order to reduce the number of HTTP requests that the browser has to make in order to load a web page. This can help to improve the performance and loading speed of the page.
