_"Bundling in JavaScript refers to the process of combining multiple JavaScript files into a single file, or bundle, in order to reduce the number of HTTP requests that the browser has to make in order to load a web page."_

Imagine that you are a retailer who sells a variety of products, and you have received an order from a customer for several items. To fulfill the order, you need to gather the requested items and package them together for shipping. This process of gathering and packaging the items is similar to bundling in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, bundling refers to the process of combining multiple JavaScript files into a single file (also known as a "bundle"). This can be useful in situations where a web application consists of multiple JavaScript files that need to be loaded by the browser in order to run. Instead of loading each file separately, the files can be bundled into a single file, which can be loaded more efficiently by the browser.

<br/>
For example, let's say that you have the following two JavaScript files:

<Code language='javascript'>

// file1.js
console.log('This is file 1');

// file2.js
console.log('This is file 2');
</Code>

To bundle these files into a single file, you can use a bundler tool such as Webpack. Using Webpack, you can create a configuration file that specifies the files to be bundled, and then run the bundler to generate the bundle:

<Code language='javascript'>

// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
&nbsp;entry: ['./file1.js', './file2.js'],
&nbsp;output: {
&nbsp;&nbsp;filename: 'bundle.js'
&nbsp;}
};
</Code>

Running the bundler with this configuration will generate a single file, bundle.js, which contains the contents of both file1.js and file2.js:

<Code language='javascript'>

// bundle.js
console.log('This is file 1');
console.log('This is file 2');
</Code>

Overall, bundling is a process that allows developers to combine multiple JavaScript files into
