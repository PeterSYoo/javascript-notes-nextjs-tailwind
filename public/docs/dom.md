_"The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree-like structure that represents the structure and content of a web page, and allows programs to manipulate the content and structure of the page."_

<br/>
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like hierarchy, with the document's elements (such as headings, paragraphs, and images) organized as nodes in the tree.

<br/>
The DOM allows programs to access and manipulate the content and structure of a document. For example, a program might use the DOM to change the text of a heading, add a new paragraph to a page, or delete an image.

<br/>
The DOM is not specific to a particular programming language or platform. Instead, it provides a standard set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that can be used by any programming language to interact with a document. This means that programs written in different languages can all use the DOM to manipulate the same document.

<br/>
The DOM is an important part of how web pages are created and interactive. It allows programs to dynamically update the content and structure of a page in response to user input or other events, and it enables the creation of complex, interactive web applications.
