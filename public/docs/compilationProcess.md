_"The compilation process in JavaScript involves writing code, transpiling it to a version that is compatible with the target web browser, bundling it into a single file, and minifying it to make it as small and efficient as possible."_

<br/>
The compilation process typically involves the following steps:

<br/>
- Writing code: This is the first step, where you use a text editor like Visual Studio Code to write your JavaScript code.
- Transpiling: Once you have written your code, it may need to be "transpiled," or converted from one version of JavaScript to another. This is often necessary because different web browsers support different versions of JavaScript, and you may need to write your code in a version that is compatible with all the browsers you want to support.
- Parsing: Once the JavaScript code has been transpiled (if necessary), it is passed through a parser, which analyzes the code and generates an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of its structure. The AST is a tree-like structure that represents the program's code in a way that is easier for the computer to process.
- Bundling: Next, your code may be "bundled" into a single file, which makes it more efficient to load and run in the browser. Bundling can also help reduce the number of network requests that need to be made when loading a page, which can improve performance.
- Minification: The final step in the compilation process is often "minification," which involves removing unnecessary characters and formatting from your code to make it as small as possible. This can improve the speed at which your code is loaded and run in the browser.
- Executing: After the JavaScript program has been parsed and an AST has been generated, it can be executed by the web browser or runtime environment. This involves carrying out the instructions written in the program, in the order that they are written. The results of the program's execution can be seen by the user through the program's output (e.g., changes to the web page, user interactions, etc.).

<br/>
It's important to note that not all JavaScript programs will go through all of these steps, and the specific steps that are taken can vary depending on the tools and technologies being used.

<br/>
However, this list covers many of the key steps that are typically involved in the process of compiling and executing JavaScript code. Writing code is the first step, and transpiling may be necessary if the code needs to be converted to a different version of JavaScript. Parsing involves analyzing the code and generating an AST, and bundling combines multiple JavaScript files into a single file. Minification removes unnecessary characters and formatting, and executing the code involves carrying out the instructions written in the program.

For this example, let's use Next.js, the framework that this app is using.

<br/>
Next.js is a framework for building server-rendered or statically exported React applications. One of the key features of Next.js is that it handles the transpiling, parsing, and execution of your code for you, so you can focus on writing your application.

<br/>
When you create a Next.js app, the framework will automatically transpile and parse your code using tools like Babel and Webpack. This allows you to use the latest features of JavaScript (or other languages) and still have your code work in older browsers or runtime environments.

<br/>
Next.js also handles the execution of your code for you. When a user requests a page in your Next.js app, the framework will execute the code needed to render the page on the server, and send the resulting HTML to the browser. This allows your app to be server-rendered, which can improve the performance and SEO of your app.

<br/>
Next.js also provides features for statically exporting your app, which allows you to pre-render the HTML of your pages and serve them directly from a CDN. This can be useful for increasing the performance and scalability of your app.
