_"The compilation process in JavaScript involves writing code, transpiling it to a version that is compatible with the target web browser, bundling it into a single file, and minifying it to make it as small and efficient as possible."_

<br/>
The compilation process typically involves the following steps:

<br/>
- Writing code: This is the first step, where you use a text editor like Visual Studio Code to write your JavaScript code.
- Transpiling: Once you have written your code, it may need to be "transpiled," or converted from one version of JavaScript to another. This is often necessary because different web browsers support different versions of JavaScript, and you may need to write your code in a version that is compatible with all the browsers you want to support.
- Parsing: Once the JavaScript code has been transpiled (if necessary), it is passed through a parser, which analyzes the code and generates an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of its structure. The AST is a tree-like structure that represents the program's code in a way that is easier for the computer to process.
- Bundling: Next, your code may be "bundled" into a single file, which makes it more efficient to load and run in the browser. Bundling can also help reduce the number of network requests that need to be made when loading a page, which can improve performance.
- Minification: The final step in the compilation process is often "minification," which involves removing unnecessary characters and formatting from your code to make it as small as possible. This can improve the speed at which your code is loaded and run in the browser.
- Executing: After the JavaScript program has been parsed and an AST has been generated, it can be executed by the web browser or runtime environment. This involves carrying out the instructions written in the program, in the order that they are written. The results of the program's execution can be seen by the user through the program's output (e.g., changes to the web page, user interactions, etc.).

<br/>
It's important to note that not all JavaScript programs will go through all of these steps, and the specific steps that are taken can vary depending on the tools and technologies being used.

<br/>
However, this list covers many of the key steps that are typically involved in the process of compiling and executing JavaScript code. Writing code is the first step, and transpiling may be necessary if the code needs to be converted to a different version of JavaScript. Parsing involves analyzing the code and generating an AST, and bundling combines multiple JavaScript files into a single file. Minification removes unnecessary characters and formatting, and executing the code involves carrying out the instructions written in the program.

<br/>
In the context of a web server, the process of "compiling" JavaScript code is typically not relevant, because JavaScript code is usually not compiled in the traditional sense. Instead, JavaScript code is typically interpreted by the web browser or other JavaScript runtime environment, which means that it is executed directly from the source code without the need for any pre-processing or compilation.

<br/>
One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to be executed directly by the web browser, without the need for any additional tools or compilation steps. This makes it a very convenient language for writing code that runs in the browser, as it allows developers to write code and see the results immediately, without the need to compile the code first.

<br/>
However, it's important to note that there are some tools and frameworks that can be used to pre-compile JavaScript code in order to optimize its performance. For example, tools like Webpack and Rollup can be used to bundle and optimize JavaScript code for use in a web browser. These tools can perform various optimization techniques, such as minification and tree-shaking, to reduce the size of the code and improve its performance.

<br/>
So, while the web browser does not typically need compiled code in order to execute JavaScript, there are tools and techniques available that can be used to optimize the performance of JavaScript code if needed.

<br/>
For this example, let's use Next.js, the framework that this app is using.

<br/>
Next.js is a framework for building server-rendered or statically exported React applications. One of the key features of Next.js is that it handles the transpiling, parsing, and execution of your code for you, so you can focus on writing your application.

<br/>
When you create a Next.js app, the framework will automatically transpile and parse your code using tools like Babel and Webpack. This allows you to use the latest features of JavaScript (or other languages) and still have your code work in older browsers or runtime environments.

<br/>
Next.js also handles the execution of your code for you. When a user requests a page in your Next.js app, the framework will execute the code needed to render the page on the server, and send the resulting HTML to the browser. This allows your app to be server-rendered, which can improve the performance and SEO of your app.

<br/>
In the context of web development, "server rendering" and "client rendering" refer to the process of rendering a web page on the server or on the client (typically a web browser), respectively.

<br/>
Server rendering refers to the process of rendering a web page on the server and sending the resulting HTML to the client. This approach has the advantage of allowing the server to do the heavy lifting of generating the HTML, which can be more efficient than having the client do it. Server rendering is often used in cases where the HTML needs to be generated dynamically, based on data that is not available to the client.

<br/>
Client rendering, on the other hand, refers to the process of rendering a web page on the client (typically a web browser). This approach has the advantage of allowing the client to handle the rendering of the page, which can reduce the load on the server and improve the overall performance of the application. Client rendering is often used in cases where the HTML is relatively static and does not need to be generated dynamically on the server.

<br/>
It's important to note that server rendering and client rendering are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible to use a combination of both approaches in a single application. For example, it is common to use server rendering to generate the initial HTML for a web page, and then use client rendering to update the page dynamically based on user interactions.

<br/>
Next.js also provides features for statically exporting your app, which allows you to pre-render the HTML of your pages and serve them directly from a CDN. This can be useful for increasing the performance and scalability of your app.
