Modern web browsers are multi-threaded programs, which means they can execute multiple threads concurrently. This allows them to run multiple web apps at the same time, as well as perform other tasks such as rendering the web page, handling user input, and communicating with servers.

<br/>
For example, if you have multiple tabs open in your web browser, each tab can be running its own web app, and the browser can execute these apps concurrently on different threads. This allows you to have multiple web apps running at the same time and switch between them without experiencing any delays.

<br/>
It is also worth noting that most modern web browsers have a process isolation model, which means that each web app runs in its own process or sandbox. This helps to improve the stability and security of the web browser by preventing one web app from affecting the others.

<br/>
The execution of a JavaScript web app in a browser can be spread out across multiple threads, depending on how the app is designed and how the browser's JavaScript engine is implemented.

<br/>
In general, modern JavaScript engines use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to improve the performance of JavaScript code, and this compilation typically occurs in a separate thread. This allows the browser to continue executing other tasks, such as rendering the web page and handling user input, while the JavaScript code is being compiled.

<br/>
Once the JavaScript code has been compiled, it can be executed concurrently on multiple threads, depending on the browser and the specific capabilities of the device it is running on. For example, a browser running on a device with multiple CPU cores may be able to execute the JavaScript code concurrently on multiple cores, which can improve the performance of the app.

<br/>
It is also worth noting that modern JavaScript engines use advanced optimization techniques to ensure that the JavaScript code is executed efficiently, and this can involve executing the code on a single thread or spreading it out across multiple threads, depending on the specific characteristics of the code and the device it is running on.
