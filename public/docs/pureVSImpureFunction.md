_"In React, a pure function is a function that always returns the same output for a given set of input values, and does not have any side effects, while an impure function is a function that may return different outputs for the same set of input values and may have side effects."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are a chef in a restaurant, and you are responsible for preparing a dish called "Chicken Alfredo."

<br/>
A pure function in this context would be like a recipe for Chicken Alfredo that you follow every time you make the dish. The recipe specifies a set of ingredients and steps that you need to follow in order to prepare the dish, and as long as you follow the recipe correctly, you will always get the same result - a delicious Chicken Alfredo. The recipe is a pure function because it always produces the same output (Chicken Alfredo) for a given set of input values (the ingredients and steps).

<br/>
On the other hand, an impure function in this context could be like a cook who improvises while preparing the Chicken Alfredo. The cook may decide to add or remove ingredients on a whim, or change the order of the steps in the recipe. This could lead to unpredictable results - sometimes the Chicken Alfredo will turn out great, but other times it may be overcooked or underwhelming. The cook is an impure function because they may produce different outputs (various versions of Chicken Alfredo) for the same set of input values (the ingredients and steps).

<br/>
In the same way, pure functions in React always return the same output for a given set of input values (props and state) and do not have any side effects, while impure functions may return different outputs for the same set of input values and may have side effects (such as making API calls or modifying the DOM). It is generally recommended to use pure functions in React components to make them easier to understand and debug.

<br/>
Here is an example of a pure function in React:

<Code language='javascript'>

function calculateTotal(price, tax) {
&nbsp;return price + (price \* tax);
}
</Code>

This function takes in two input values (price and tax) and returns the total price after adding the tax. The function is pure because it always returns the same output for a given set of input values.

<br/>
Here is an example of an impure function in React:

<Code language='javascript'>

function fetchUserData(userId) {
&nbsp;// Make an API call to retrieve user data
&nbsp;const userData = api.get('URL');
&nbsp;return userData;
}

</Code>

This function makes an API call to retrieve user data and returns the data. The function is impure because it has a side effect (making an API call) and because the returned data may be different each time the function is called (depending on the user data stored in the API).

<br/>
###So if an impure function does something else inside the function that changes an outside variable, that's considered impure?

<br/>
Yes, if an impure function has a side effect of modifying an external variable, that means it is impure. A side effect is any action or operation that has an effect outside the function in which it is performed. In the case of modifying an external variable, the side effect is changing the value of the variable, which can affect the behavior of other parts of the program.

<br/>
Here is an example of an impure function that has a side effect of modifying an external variable:

<Code language='javascript'>

let counter = 0;
function addOne(x) {
&nbsp;counter += 1;
&nbsp;return x + 1;
}

</Code>

This function takes in a number and returns a new number that is one greater than the input value. However, the function is impure because it has a side effect of modifying the value of the counter variable. The function is also impure because the value of counter may be different each time the function is called, which means the function may return different outputs for the same input value.

<br/>
On the other hand, here is an example of a pure function that does not have any side effects:

<Code language='javascript'>

function addOne(x) {
&nbsp;return x + 1;
}

</Code>

This function takes in a number and returns a new number that is one greater than the input value. The function is pure because it does not have any side effects. It simply takes in an input value, performs an operation on it, and returns the result. The function will always return the same output for a given input value, regardless of how many times it is called.
