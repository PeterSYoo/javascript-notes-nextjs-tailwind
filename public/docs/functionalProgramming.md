_"Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and promotes immutability, first-class functions, and higher-order functions."_

<br/>
Functional programming in JavaScript can be thought of as a recipe for making a dish. When you follow a recipe to make a dish, you are given a set of instructions that describe how to combine ingredients and prepare them in a specific way to produce a finished dish. Each step in the recipe is a function that takes one or more ingredients (inputs) and produces a result (output). For example, a recipe might say to "chop the onions" or "mix the dough".

<br/>
In the same way, functional programming involves creating and using functions to perform specific tasks and produce a result. Functions in functional programming are "pure" functions, which means they have no side effects and always produce the same output for a given input. This makes it easier to reason about and test your code, because you know that a function will always produce the same result for a given input.

<br/>
Functional programming also promotes the use of "first-class functions", which means that functions can be treated like any other value in your code. This allows you to pass functions as arguments to other functions, or to return functions as the result of a function. This allows you to create higher-order functions, which are functions that operate on other functions.

<br/>
For example, consider a "map" function that takes an array of values and a function, and applies the function to each value in the array to produce a new array of results. Here's how you might use the "map" function:

<Code language='javascript'>

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squaredNumbers = map(numbers, (n) => n \* n);
// squaredNumbers is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
</Code>

In this example, the "map" function is a higher-order function that takes an array and a function as input, and applies the function to each value in the array to produce a new array of results. This is a common pattern in functional programming, where you use higher-order functions to abstract common patterns and operations.

<br/>
In this way, functional programming in JavaScript involves creating and using functions to perform specific tasks and produce a result, and promoting the use of pure functions, first-class functions, and higher-order functions to create reusable and composable code.
