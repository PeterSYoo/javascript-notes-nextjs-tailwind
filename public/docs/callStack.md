_"In JavaScript, the call stack is a data structure that stores the execution context of the program, including the current function being executed and the values of its local variables."_

<br/>
The call stack is a data structure in JavaScript that is used to keep track of the execution of function calls. It is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) stack that stores information about the active functions that are being executed in a program.

<br/>
In a single-threaded language like JavaScript, the call stack plays a crucial role in the execution of blocking and non-blocking code. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the call stack and is executed. If the function calls other functions, those functions are also added to the top of the stack and are executed in turn. When a function finishes executing, it is removed from the top of the stack, and the next function on the stack is executed.

<br/>
This process of adding and removing functions from the stack can have an impact on the performance of a program, particularly in the case of blocking code. If a function takes a long time to execute, it will block the execution of other functions and will remain on the top of the stack until it finishes. This can cause the call stack to grow larger, which can lead to memory issues and can impact the overall performance of the program.

<br/>
On the other hand, non-blocking code does not have this same impact on the call stack, as it allows other functions to be executed concurrently and does not block the execution of subsequent code. This can help to improve the performance of a program and can allow it to make better use of available resources.
