_"In JavaScript, the call stack is a data structure that stores the execution context of the program, including the current function being executed and the values of its local variables."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are planning a road trip with a group of friends. You have a map of all the destinations you want to visit, and the call stack is like a list of all the stops you need to make along the way. When you first start the trip, the first destination is added to the top of the list. As you drive to this destination, you may come across a detour or side trip that you want to take. This is like calling a function within your code. The new destination for the detour or side trip is added to the top of the list, and the trip continues following this new destination until it is completed.

<br/>
Once the detour or side trip is finished, the destination is removed from the top of the list and the trip returns to the destination below it on the list. The call stack keeps track of all of the destinations that have been planned for the trip, with the most recently added destination at the top of the list. As the trip progresses, the list grows and shrinks as new destinations are added and completed.

<br/>
The call stack is a data structure in JavaScript that is used to keep track of the execution of function calls. It is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) stack that stores information about the active functions that are being executed in a program.

<br/>
In a single-threaded language like JavaScript, the call stack plays a crucial role in the execution of blocking and non-blocking code.

<br/>
When a function is called, an execution context is created for the function and is added to the top of the call stack. This execution context contains information about the function, including its arguments and local variables, as well as a reference to the execution context of the calling function. When the function returns, its execution context is removed from the top of the call stack, and the next execution context in the stack becomes the current execution context. If the function calls other functions, those functions are also added to the top of the stack and are executed in turn. When a function finishes executing, it is removed from the top of the stack, and the next function on the stack is executed. So, in a way, you could say that the execution context is what gets sent to the call stack.

<br/>
This process of adding and removing functions from the stack can have an impact on the performance of a program, particularly in the case of blocking code. If a function takes a long time to execute, it will block the execution of other functions and will remain on the top of the stack until it finishes. This can cause the call stack to grow larger, which can lead to memory issues and can impact the overall performance of the program.

<br/>
On the other hand, non-blocking code does not have this same impact on the call stack, as it allows other functions to be executed concurrently and does not block the execution of subsequent code. This can help to improve the performance of a program and can allow it to make better use of available resources.
