HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It consists of a series of elements, represented by tags, which define the structure and content of a webpage. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and typically come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.

<br/>
For example, the following HTML code creates a simple webpage with a heading and a paragraph of text:

```

  <html>
    <head>
      <title>My Webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Welcome to my webpage</h1>
      <p>This is some sample text.</p>
    </body>
  </html>

```

This code would be displayed in a web browser as:
Welcome to my webpage
This is some sample text.

<br/>
HTML tags can also have attributes, which provide additional information about an element, such as the src attribute of an `<img>` tag, which specifies the URL of the image to be displayed.

It is important to note that the HTML is just the structure, the way it looks and behaves on the web page will still depends on other technologies such as CSS and JavaScript.
