Executing JavaScript code in a web browser is like following a recipe to cook a dish. Just as a recipe lists a series of ingredients and instructions that tell you what to do in order to prepare a dish, JavaScript code consists of a series of commands and operations that tell the browser what to do. Just as a chef reads through a recipe and follows the instructions in order to cook a dish, the browser reads through the JavaScript code and executes the commands in order to perform the tasks or operations specified by the code.
