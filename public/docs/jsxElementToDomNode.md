Here is a step-by-step description of what happens when a JSX element is rendered to a DOM node in a React application:

<br/>
- The JSX compiler transforms the JSX element into a call to React's createElement() function. For example, the JSX element:

```

  <div className="my-div">
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
  </div>

```

<br/>
might be compiled into something like this:

<Code language='javascript'>

React.createElement("div", { className: "my-div" },
&nbsp;React.createElement("p", null, "Hello, world!")
);

</Code>

- The createElement() function creates a virtual DOM element, which is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM element.
  <br/>
- React compares the virtual DOM element to the previous version of the element (if any), and determines the minimal set of changes that need to be made to the actual DOM to bring it up to date.
  <br/>
- React updates the actual DOM with the changes that were determined in the previous step.
  <br/>
- The DOM element is now updated and reflects the changes made to the virtual DOM element.
