_"In React, context is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are a school principal responsible for managing a large school with multiple buildings and classrooms. To communicate important information to the teachers and students, you have set up a system of intercoms throughout the school. The intercoms are connected to a central control room, where you can make announcements that will be broadcasted throughout the school.

<br/>
In this system, the intercoms act as "context providers," as they provide a way for you (the principal) to communicate with the teachers and students. The teachers and students are "context consumers," as they receive the announcements through the intercoms.

<br/>
In React, context works in a similar way. The context provider is a component that provides a value for a context, and the context consumers are components that receive the value from the context provider.

<br/>
For example, consider the following code written in React:

```

  import React from 'react';

  const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

  function App() {
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
        <Toolbar />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }

  function Toolbar() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ThemedButton />
      </div>
    );
  }

  function ThemedButton() {
    const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
    return <button>{theme}</button>;
  }

```

<br/>
In this code, the `App` component is the context provider, as it provides a value for the `ThemeContext` context. The `ThemedButton` component is the context consumer, as it receives the value of the `ThemeContext` context and uses it to set the theme of the button.

<br/>
Overall, context in React is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. The context provider is a component that provides a value for a context, and the context consumers are components that receive the value from the context provider.
