_"Transpiling in JavaScript refers to the process of converting code written in one programming language into another programming language that has a similar level of abstraction, with the goal of making the code executable in a specific environment (such as a web browser)."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are a student who is studying abroad in a country where the primary language is different from your own. To communicate with the locals, you use a translation app on your phone to translate words and phrases from your native language to the local language, and vice versa. This process of translation is similar to transpiling in JavaScript.

<br/>
For example, let's say that your native language is English, and you want to translate the following phrase into Spanish:

<Code language='javascript'>

"I would like to order a coffee, please."
</Code>

Using a translation app, you can enter this phrase in English and have it automatically translated into Spanish:

<Code language='javascript'>

"Me gustaría pedir un café, por favor."
</Code>

In the same way, transpiling in JavaScript involves converting code written in one programming language (the "source" language) into code written in a different programming language (the "target" language). Let's say that you have the following code written in the source language of TypeScript:

<Code language='javascript'>

function greet(name: string) {
&nbsp;console.log('Hello' + name + '!');
}
</Code>

To convert this code into the target language of JavaScript, you can use a transpiler. The transpiler will take the TypeScript code and convert it into equivalent JavaScript code:

<Code language='javascript'>

function greet(name) {
&nbsp;console.log('Hello' + name + '!');
}
</Code>

Overall, transpiling is a process that allows developers to write code in a certain programming language, and then convert that code into a different programming language that can be understood and executed by other systems. This can be useful in situations where the target system is unable to run the source code directly.
