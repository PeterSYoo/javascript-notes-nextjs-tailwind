If you are trying to work with complex data in a useState hook in a React component, there are a few things you can do:

<br/>
Use the spread operator to create a new object or array that contains the existing state and the new data you want to add. For example:

<Code language='javascript'>

const [state, setState] = useState({});

const addData = newData => {
&nbsp;setState({ ...state, ...newData });
};

</Code>

Use the useReducer hook, which is designed to manage complex state updates. It works similarly to the reduce function in functional programming, where you can specify a reducer function that takes the current state and an action as arguments, and returns a new state.

<Code language='javascript'>

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

const addData = newData => {
&nbsp;dispatch({ type: 'ADD_DATA', payload: newData });
};

</Code>

Consider breaking your complex state object into multiple, smaller pieces of state. This can make it easier to manage and update your component's state.
