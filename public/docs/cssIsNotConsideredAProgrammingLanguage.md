CSS is not considered a programming language because it doesn't have the ability to calculate, make decisions, or perform any type of logical operations. It is a markup language, specifically a stylesheet language, that is used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language.

CSS is used to apply styles, such as colors, layouts, and spacing, to the elements of a document written in a markup language, like HTML or XML. These styles are then interpreted by web browsers and applied to the corresponding elements on the page. It lacks the ability to do any calculations or decision making, making it different from a programming language.

While it has some concepts that overlap with programming like selectors, cascading and inheritance but it lacks the full range of capabilities that a programming language has to offer. It's a tool for styling and presentation rather than programming.
