_"In JavaScript, higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as output, allowing for the creation of more flexible and reusable code."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are a personal assistant to a busy executive. Your job is to handle a variety of tasks and projects for the executive, and to delegate tasks to other team members as needed.

<br/>
Higher order functions in JavaScript can be thought of as similar to a personal assistant. Just as a personal assistant takes on tasks and projects and delegates them to others as needed, a higher order function takes one or more functions as arguments and returns a new function that combines the behavior of those functions in some way.

<br/>
For example, a higher order function might take two functions as arguments and return a new function that combines the behavior of those two functions. Or, it might take a function and a value as arguments, and return a new function that modifies the behavior of the original function using the value.

<br/>
Just as a personal assistant helps the executive to manage and coordinate various tasks and projects, a higher order function helps to manage and coordinate the behavior of other functions in a program.

<br/>
Overall, higher order functions in JavaScript are functions that take one or more functions as arguments and return a new function that combines or modifies the behavior of those functions, in a way that is similar to a personal assistant handling tasks and delegating them to others as needed.

<br/>
One way to define higher-order functions in JavaScript is using arrow functions. Arrow functions are a concise way to define anonymous functions, and they allow you to omit the function keyword and the curly braces. Here are some examples of higher-order functions using arrow functions:

<Code language='javascript'>

// This is a higher-order function that takes a function and an argument,
// and returns a new function that is the result of applying the original
// function to the argument.
const applyFunction = (fn, arg) => (() => fn(arg));

// This is a higher-order function that takes a function and returns a new
// function that is the result of applying the original function to its
// arguments reversed.
const reverseArgs = fn => (...args) => fn(...args.reverse());

// This is a higher-order function that takes a function and returns a new
// function that caches the result of calling the original function.
const cacheFunction = fn => {
&nbsp;let cache = new Map();
&nbsp;return (...args) => {
&nbsp;&nbsp;const key = JSON.stringify(args);
&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!cache.has(key)) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cache.set(key, fn(...args));
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;return cache.get(key);
&nbsp;};
};
</Code>
