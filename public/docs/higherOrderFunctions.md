_"In JavaScript, higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as output, allowing for the creation of more flexible and reusable code."_

<br/>
Higher order functions in JavaScript can be thought of as a recipe for a dish. A recipe is a set of instructions that tells you how to combine ingredients and cook them in a certain way to make a specific dish. Just like a recipe, a higher order function is a set of instructions that tells you how to take one or more functions as inputs, and use them to perform a specific task.

<br/>
For example, consider a recipe for making a cake. The recipe might include instructions for mixing flour, sugar, eggs, and butter to make the cake batter, as well as instructions for baking the cake in the oven. The recipe can be thought of as a higher order function, because it takes the functions of mixing and baking as inputs and combines them to make a finished cake.

<br/>
In the same way, a higher order function in JavaScript takes one or more functions as inputs and uses them to perform a specific task. These functions can be passed as arguments to the higher order function, and the higher order function can execute them at the appropriate times to complete its task.

<br/>
Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. For example, you can have a higher-order function that takes a function and an argument, and returns a new function that is the result of applying the original function to the argument.

<br/>
One way to define higher-order functions in JavaScript is using arrow functions. Arrow functions are a concise way to define anonymous functions, and they allow you to omit the function keyword and the curly braces. Here are some examples of higher-order functions using arrow functions:

<Code language='javascript'>

// This is a higher-order function that takes a function and an argument,
// and returns a new function that is the result of applying the original
// function to the argument.
const applyFunction = (fn, arg) => (() => fn(arg));

// This is a higher-order function that takes a function and returns a new
// function that is the result of applying the original function to its
// arguments reversed.
const reverseArgs = fn => (...args) => fn(...args.reverse());

// This is a higher-order function that takes a function and returns a new
// function that caches the result of calling the original function.
const cacheFunction = fn => {
&nbsp;let cache = new Map();
&nbsp;return (...args) => {
&nbsp;&nbsp;const key = JSON.stringify(args);
&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!cache.has(key)) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cache.set(key, fn(...args));
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;return cache.get(key);
&nbsp;};
};
</Code>
