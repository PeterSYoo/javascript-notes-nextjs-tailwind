_"In React, mounting is the process of creating a component and rendering it to the DOM."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are a builder responsible for constructing a house. To build the house, you must first gather the materials and tools that you need, such as bricks, wood, nails, and a hammer. You then use these materials and tools to create the various parts of the house, such as the walls, roof, and doors.

<br/>
Once the various parts of the house are constructed, you must then "mount" them to the foundation of the house. This involves attaching the walls to the foundation, placing the roof on top of the walls, and installing the doors in the appropriate openings.

<br/>
In React, mounting is similar to the process of constructing and mounting a house. To create a component, you must first gather the materials and tools that you need (such as JSX, CSS, and JavaScript). You then use these materials and tools to create the various parts of the component, such as the UI and logic.

<br/>
Once the component is created, it must then be "mounted" to the DOM. This involves creating a DOM element for the component, rendering the component's UI to the DOM element, and attaching the DOM element to the appropriate location in the page.

<br/>
For example, consider the following code written in React:

```

  import React from 'react';
  import { render } from 'react-dom';

  function App() {
    return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
  }

  render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

<br/>
In this code, the App component is created and rendered to the DOM. The render function is used to mount the component to the DOM element with the id of "root," which is located in the HTML page.

<br/>
Overall, mounting in React is the process of creating a component and rendering it to the DOM. It involves creating a DOM element for the component, rendering the component's UI to the DOM element, and attaching the DOM element to the appropriate location in the page.

<br/>
##When does a component mount?

<br/>
A component mounts in React when it is created and rendered to the DOM for the first time.

<br/>
In React, there are two types of components: functional components and class-based components. A functional component mounts when it is called for the first time and its rendered output is added to the DOM. A class-based component mounts when an instance of the class is created and its render method is called for the first time.

<br/>
For example, consider the following code written in React:

```

  import React from 'react';
  import { render } from 'react-dom';

  function App() {
    return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
  }

  render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

<br/>
In this code, the `App` functional component mounts when it is called for the first time and its rendered output is added to the DOM. The `render` function is used to mount the component to the DOM element with the `id` of "root," which is located in the HTML page.

<br/>
On the other hand, if the `App` component was a class-based component, it would mount when an instance of the `App` class is created and its `render` method is called for the first time.

<br/>
For example:

```

  import React from 'react';
  import { render } from 'react-dom';

  class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
    }
  }

  render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

<br/>
In this code, the `App` class-based component mounts when an instance of the `App` class is created and its `render` method is called for the first time. The `render` function is used to mount the component to the DOM element with the `id` of "root," which is located in the HTML page.

<br/>
Overall, a component mounts in React when it is created and rendered to the DOM for the first time. This can happen when a functional component is called for the first time, or when an instance of a class-based component is created and its `render` method is called for the first time.
