_"Declarative programming in JavaScript involves writing code that describes what a program should do, rather than specifying the steps that the program should take to achieve a desired result."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are planning a party. Declarative programming can be thought of as a list of instructions that you give to your assistant to help them prepare for the party.

<br/>
For example, you might say "please buy some snacks, set up tables and chairs, and decorate the room with streamers." These instructions are declarative in nature, as they simply declare what needs to be done without specifying exactly how it should be done. Your assistant can use their own discretion and expertise to determine the most efficient and effective way to carry out these tasks.

<br/>
In the same way, declarative programming involves providing a list of instructions or declarations to the computer, without specifying the exact steps that should be taken to carry them out. The computer can then use its own algorithms and processes to determine the most efficient way to execute the code.

<br/>
Overall, declarative programming involves focusing on what needs to be done rather than how it should be done, allowing the computer to take care of the implementation details.

<br/>
One way to think about the difference between declarative and imperative programming is to consider the difference between telling someone what you want them to do and telling them how to do it. For example, if you wanted someone to make a sandwich, you could give them a list of declarative instructions, such as "spread peanut butter on one slice of bread, spread jelly on the other slice of bread, and then put the slices together." These instructions describe the final result that you want (a peanut butter and jelly sandwich), but they don't specify the exact steps that the person should take to achieve that result (e.g., "pick up the knife, hold it in your right hand, use a sawing motion to spread the peanut butter on the bread"). In this way, declarative programming involves describing what you want the program to do, rather than specifying how the program should do it.

<br/>
On the other hand, imperative programming involves writing code that explicitly specifies the steps that a program should take to achieve a desired result. For example, you could give someone a list of imperative instructions to make a sandwich, such as "pick up the knife, hold it in your right hand, spread peanut butter on one slice of bread, put the knife down, pick up the jelly, hold it in your left hand, spread jelly on the other slice of bread, put the jelly down, and then put the slices together." These instructions specify exactly how the person should make the sandwich, step by step. In this way, imperative programming involves specifying how the program should do something, rather than just describing what you want it to do.

Here is an example of declarative programming in JavaScript:

<Code language='javascript'>

// Declarative programming example

// Declare a function that filters an array of numbers and returns
// a new array containing only the even numbers
function filterEvenNumbers(numbers) {
&nbsp;return numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
}

// Use the function to filter an array of numbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evenNumbers = filterEvenNumbers(numbers);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
</Code>

In this example, the `filterEvenNumbers` function uses the `filter` method to declaratively specify that we want to create a new array containing only the even numbers from the input array. The `filter` method handles the imperative details of how to accomplish this task (e.g., iterating over the elements of the array, determining which elements are even, and adding them to the new array).

<br/>
Here is an example of imperative programming in JavaScript that achieves the same result as the declarative example above:

<Code language='javascript'>

// Imperative programming example

// Declare a function that filters an array of numbers and returns
// a new array containing only the even numbers
function filterEvenNumbers(numbers) {
&nbsp;const evenNumbers = [];
&nbsp;for (const num of numbers) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;if (num % 2 === 0) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evenNumbers.push(num);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;return evenNumbers;
}

// Use the function to filter an array of numbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evenNumbers = filterEvenNumbers(numbers);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
</Code>

In this example, the `filterEvenNumbers` function uses a loop and an if statement to imperatively specify the steps that the program should take to filter the input array and create a new array containing only the even numbers. The program specifies exactly how the task should be accomplished, rather than just describing the desired result (as in the declarative example).
