JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means that it can only execute one task at a time. This is in contrast to multi-threaded programming languages, which can execute multiple tasks concurrently.

In general, a single-threaded program will only use a single CPU core at a time, and JavaScript is no exception. However, it's important to note that JavaScript is a high-level language, and it does not execute tasks directly on the CPU. Instead, the JavaScript engine interprets and executes the JavaScript code. Some JavaScript engines may use multiple threads internally to optimize the execution of JavaScript code, but from the perspective of the JavaScript programmer, the language is still single-threaded.

Since JavaScript can only execute one task at a time, it is considered a synchronous language. This means that tasks are executed in the order in which they are encountered, and the program will block until a task is completed before moving on to the next one. The call stack is a data structure that is used to keep track of the execution context of a program, and in JavaScript, it reflects the single-threaded nature of the language by allowing only one task to be at the top of the stack at a time.
