_"In JavaScript, async/await is a language feature that enables the use of asynchronous, non-blocking code by allowing the programmer to write asynchronous code using a synchronous-looking syntax."_

<br/>
Imagine that you are a customer at a store, and you want to purchase an item that is currently out of stock. The store clerk tells you that the item will be restocked the next day, and offers to hold the item for you until it becomes available.

<br/>
In the same way, the async/await keywords in JavaScript allow you to "hold" the execution of a program until a certain asynchronous event (such as a network request) has completed. When you use the async keyword to define a function, it tells the program to "hold" the execution of that function until the asynchronous event has completed. Then, you can use the await keyword to "wait" for the asynchronous event to finish before continuing with the rest of the function.

<br/>
Just as the store clerk holds the item for you until it becomes available, the async/await keywords allow you to pause the execution of a program until an asynchronous event has completed. And just as you can come back to the store the next day to pick up the item that you have held, you can use the async/await keywords to resume the execution of a program once the asynchronous event has finished.

<br/>
Overall, the async/await keywords in JavaScript allow you to pause the execution of a program and wait for an asynchronous event to complete, in a way that is similar to holding an item at a store until it becomes available. This can make it easier to write asynchronous code in a way that is more synchronous and easier to read and understand.

<br/>
`async`/`await` is a language feature introduced in ECMAScript 2017 that allows you to write asynchronous code in a way that looks synchronous.

<br/>
In JavaScript, when you execute a long-running operation, such as making an HTTP request, the browser blocks the JavaScript execution thread until the operation finishes. This can cause the UI to freeze, making it difficult for the user to interact with the page.

<Br/>
To avoid this, you can use asynchronous programming techniques, such as Promises, which allow you to run long-running operations in the background, without blocking the JavaScript execution thread.

<br/>
`async`/`await` is a higher-level syntax built on top of Promises, that makes it easier to write asynchronous code.

<br/>
Here's an example of using Promises to make an HTTP request:

<Code language='javascript'>

fetch('URL')
&nbsp;.then(response => response.json())
&nbsp;.then(data => console.log(data))
&nbsp;.catch(error => console.error(error));
</Code>

Here's the same example, using `async`/`await`:

<Code language='javascript'>

async function fetchData() {
&nbsp;try {
&nbsp;&nbsp;const response = await fetch('URL');
&nbsp;&nbsp;const data = await response.json();
&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(data);
&nbsp;} catch (error) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;console.error(error);
&nbsp;}
}

fetchData();
</Code>

The `async` keyword is used to define an `async` function, and the await keyword is used to wait for a Promise to be resolved.

<br/>
Inside an `async` function, you can use await to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved. This makes it easy to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous.

<br/>
While the `async` function is paused, the browser can continue executing other code, such as handling user input or rendering the UI. This makes it possible to write asynchronous code that doesn't block the JavaScript execution thread, improving the performance and responsiveness of your application.

<br/>
Here's an example using arrow functions:

<Code language='javascript'>

const fetchData = async () => {
&nbsp;try {
&nbsp;&nbsp;const response = await fetch('URL');
&nbsp;&nbsp;const data = await response.json();
&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(data);
&nbsp;} catch (error) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;console.error(error);
&nbsp;}
}

fetchData();
</Code>

Using `async`/`await` has several benefits over using Promises directly:

- It makes your code easier to read and write, because it looks more like synchronous code.
- It eliminates the need for chaining `.then()` and `.catch()` calls, which can make your code more concise.
- It allows you to use `try`/`catch` statements to handle errors, which is more familiar to developers who come from a background in synchronous languages.

<br/>
To use `async`/`await`, you need to mark a function as `async` by putting the `async` keyword before the function definition. Inside an `async` function, you can use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function and wait for a Promise to be resolved.

To call an `async` function, you just need to use the `await` keyword in front of the function call:

<Code language='javascript'>

const data = await fetchData();
</Code>

You can only use the `await` keyword inside an async function. If you try to use it outside an async function, you will get a syntax error.
