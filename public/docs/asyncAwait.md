_"In JavaScript, async/await is a language feature that enables the use of asynchronous, non-blocking code by allowing the programmer to write asynchronous code using a synchronous-looking syntax."_

<br/>
Async/await in JavaScript can be thought of as ordering food at a restaurant and waiting for it to be prepared and delivered. When you place an order at a restaurant, you typically have to wait for your food to be prepared by the chefs and brought to your table. While you are waiting, you can continue to do other things, like chat with friends or browse your phone.

<br/>
Using async/await in JavaScript is similar to this process. When you make an async function call, you are "ordering" some task to be completed. The function call returns a "promise" that the task will be completed, just like the restaurant gives you a receipt when you place an order. You can use the "await" keyword to "wait" for the task to be completed, just like you wait for your food to be delivered to your table. While you are waiting, the program can continue to do other things, just like you can continue to do other things while you wait for your food. When the task is complete, the async function will "resolve" the promise, just like the restaurant delivers your food to your table.

<br/>
`async`/`await` is a language feature introduced in ECMAScript 2017 that allows you to write asynchronous code in a way that looks synchronous.

<br/>
In JavaScript, when you execute a long-running operation, such as making an HTTP request, the browser blocks the JavaScript execution thread until the operation finishes. This can cause the UI to freeze, making it difficult for the user to interact with the page.

<Br/>
To avoid this, you can use asynchronous programming techniques, such as Promises, which allow you to run long-running operations in the background, without blocking the JavaScript execution thread.

<br/>
`async`/`await` is a higher-level syntax built on top of Promises, that makes it easier to write asynchronous code.

<br/>
Here's an example of using Promises to make an HTTP request:

<Code language='javascript'>

fetch('URL')
&nbsp;.then(response => response.json())
&nbsp;.then(data => console.log(data))
&nbsp;.catch(error => console.error(error));
</Code>

Here's the same example, using `async`/`await`:

<Code language='javascript'>

async function fetchData() {
&nbsp;try {
&nbsp;&nbsp;const response = await fetch('URL');
&nbsp;&nbsp;const data = await response.json();
&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(data);
&nbsp;} catch (error) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;console.error(error);
&nbsp;}
}

fetchData();
</Code>

The `async` keyword is used to define an `async` function, and the await keyword is used to wait for a Promise to be resolved.

<br/>
Inside an `async` function, you can use await to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved. This makes it easy to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous.

<br/>
While the `async` function is paused, the browser can continue executing other code, such as handling user input or rendering the UI. This makes it possible to write asynchronous code that doesn't block the JavaScript execution thread, improving the performance and responsiveness of your application.

<br/>
Here's an example using arrow functions:

<Code language='javascript'>

const fetchData = async () => {
&nbsp;try {
&nbsp;&nbsp;const response = await fetch('URL');
&nbsp;&nbsp;const data = await response.json();
&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(data);
&nbsp;} catch (error) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;console.error(error);
&nbsp;}
}

fetchData();
</Code>

Using `async`/`await` has several benefits over using Promises directly:

- It makes your code easier to read and write, because it looks more like synchronous code.
- It eliminates the need for chaining `.then()` and `.catch()` calls, which can make your code more concise.
- It allows you to use `try`/`catch` statements to handle errors, which is more familiar to developers who come from a background in synchronous languages.

<br/>
To use `async`/`await`, you need to mark a function as `async` by putting the `async` keyword before the function definition. Inside an `async` function, you can use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function and wait for a Promise to be resolved.

To call an `async` function, you just need to use the `await` keyword in front of the function call:

<Code language='javascript'>

const data = await fetchData();
</Code>

You can only use the `await` keyword inside an async function. If you try to use it outside an async function, you will get a syntax error.
