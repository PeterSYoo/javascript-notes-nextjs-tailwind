_"In JavaScript, a local lexical environment is created whenever a function is called, and it provides the context for the code inside the function, including the function's local variables and parameters."_

<br/>
Imagine that a local lexical environment is like a small reading room within a library. The reading room is a separate, enclosed space within the larger library, and it contains a selection of books that are specifically relevant to the task at hand.

<br/>
In the same way, a local lexical environment in JavaScript is a separate, enclosed space within the global lexical environment. It contains a selection of variables and functions that are specifically relevant to the code being executed within that local environment.

<br/>
Just as a reading room provides a focused space for reading and studying a specific topic, a local lexical environment provides a focused space for accessing and using a specific set of variables and functions within a JavaScript program. And just as a reading room is nested within the larger library and can access the books stored in the library, a local lexical environment is nested within the global lexical environment and can access the variables and functions stored there.

<br/>
The global lexical environment is represented by the global object, which is a special object that provides the global namespace for the JavaScript code that is executed in a particular context (e.g., a web page or a Node.js script).

<br/>
The local lexical environment, on the other hand, is a separate object that is created for each function when it is called. This object is used to store the local variables and function parameters for that function. It also has a reference to the outer lexical environment, which is the lexical environment in which the function was defined. This allows the function to access variables and parameters that are defined in the outer lexical environment, as well as the global lexical environment.

<Code language='javascript'>

// Global lexical environment
let globalVariable = "Hello, global!";

function greet() {
&nbsp;// Local lexical environment for greet function
&nbsp;let greeting = "Hello, local!";

&nbsp;console.log(greeting); // Output: "Hello, local!"
&nbsp;console.log(globalVariable); // Output: "Hello, global!"
}

greet();
</Code>

In this example, the global lexical environment has a single variable called globalVariable that is defined in the global scope.

<br/>
The greet function is defined in the global lexical environment, and it has its own local lexical environment. This local lexical environment contains a single variable called greeting that is defined within the function.

<br/>
When the greet function is called, it creates a new local lexical environment object and assigns it to the variable greeting. This object has a reference to the global lexical environment, which allows the function to access the globalVariable variable.

<br/>
Inside the function, the console.log statements output the values of the greeting and globalVariable variables, which demonstrate how the function is able to access variables from both its own local lexical environment and the global lexical environment.

<br/>
In JavaScript, each function has its own lexical environment, and a nested function has access to the lexical environments of all of its parent functions.
