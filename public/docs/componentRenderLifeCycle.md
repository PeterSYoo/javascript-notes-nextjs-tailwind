_"In React, the component render life cycle is the sequence of steps that a component goes through from the moment it is created to the moment it is destroyed."_

Imagine that you are a farmer responsible for growing a crop of vegetables. To grow a successful crop, you must follow a series of steps from start to finish.

<br/>
First, you must prepare the soil by tilling it, adding fertilizers and other nutrients, and ensuring that it is well-drained. Next, you must plant the seeds or seedlings in the soil, being careful to follow the correct spacing and depth guidelines.

<br/>
After planting, you must water and fertilize the soil regularly to keep the plants healthy and promote growth. As the plants mature, you must also keep an eye out for pests and diseases, and take steps to control them if necessary.

<br/>
Finally, when the vegetables are ripe and ready to be harvested, you must carefully pluck them from the plants and prepare them for sale or consumption.

<br/>
In React, the component render life cycle is similar to the process of growing a crop of vegetables. Just as there are many steps involved in growing a crop from start to finish, there are also many steps involved in a component's life cycle, from the moment it is created to the moment it is destroyed.

<br/>
Here is a summary of the steps in a component's render life cycle:

<br/>
- Mounting: The component is created and rendered to the DOM for the first time.
<br/>
- Updating: The component's state or props have changed, and the component needs to re-render itself to reflect the changes.
<br/>
- Unmounting: The component is removed from the DOM.

<br/>
Overall, the component render life cycle in React is the sequence of steps that a component goes through from the moment it is created to the moment it is destroyed. It involves mounting the component to the DOM, updating the component when its state or props change, and unmounting the component when it is no longer needed.
