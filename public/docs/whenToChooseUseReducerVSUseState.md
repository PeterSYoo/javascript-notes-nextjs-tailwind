The useState hook is best used on less complex data.

<br/>
While it's possible to use any kind of a data structure when working with useState, it's better to use it with primitive data types, such as strings, numbers, or booleans.

<br/>
The useReducer hook is best used on more complex data, specifically, arrays or objects.

<br/>
While this rule is simple enough, there are situations where you might be working with a simple object and still decide to use the useState hook.

<br/>
Such a decision might stem from the simple fact that working with useState can sometimes feel easier than thinking about how the state is controlled when working with useReducer.

<br/>
It might help conceptualizing this dilemma as a gradual scale, on the left side of which, there is the useState hook with primitive data types and simple use cases, such as toggling a variable on or off.

<br/>
At the end of this spectrum, there is the useReducer hook used to control state of large state-holding objects.

<br/>
There's no clear-cut point on this spectrum, at which point you would decide: "If my state object has three or more properties, I'll use the useReducer hook".

<br/>
Sometimes such a statement might make sense, and other times it might not.

<br/>
What's important to remember is to keep your code simple to understand, collaborate on, contribute to, and build from.

<br/>
One negative characteristic of useState is that it often gets hard to maintain as the state gets more complex.

<br/>
On the flip side, a negative characteristic of useReducer is that it requires more prep work to begin with. There's more setup involved. However, once this setup is completed, it gets easier to extend the code based on new requirements.

<br/>
useReducer is usually a better choice than useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

<br/>
Here's an example of when you might use useReducer:

<Code language='javascript'>

const todoReducer = (state, action) => {
&nbsp;switch (action.type) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;case 'ADD_TODO':
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;todos: [...state.todos, { text: action.text, completed: false }],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;todoCount: state.todoCount + 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};
&nbsp;&nbsp;case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;todos: state.todos.map((t, idx) => idx === action.index ? {...t, completed: !t.completed } : t),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;todoCount: state.todoCount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};
&nbsp;&nbsp;default:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return state;
&nbsp;}
}

const initialState = { todos: [], todoCount: 0 };

const TodoList = () => {
&nbsp;const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(todoReducer, initialState);
&nbsp;// ...
}

</Code>

In this example, the state has two values: todos and todoCount. useReducer allows you to manage them in a single reducer function, rather than using multiple useState calls.

<br/>
On the other hand, if your state is a simple value that doesn't depend on any other state values, you can use useState.

<br/>
Here's an example:

<Code language='javascript'>

const Counter = () => {
&nbsp;const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
&nbsp;// ...
}

</Code>

Here are a few more points to consider when deciding between useReducer and useState:

<br/>
- useReducer allows you to separate your state logic from your component, which can make your code easier to test and reuse.
<br/>
- useReducer can be slower than useState, because it requires an extra function call on each update. However, the performance difference is usually small and not noticeable in most cases.
<br/>
- useState is generally easier to use and understand than useReducer, especially for simple state changes.

<br/>
Ultimately, the choice between useReducer and useState depends on the specific needs of your component. If you're not sure which one to use, you can start with useState and switch to useReducer if you find that your state logic is becoming too complex.
