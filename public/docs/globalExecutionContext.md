The global execution context is a virtual environment in which JavaScript code is executed. When a JavaScript program starts running, the global execution context is created and provides a space for declarations, such as variables and functions, to be made. These declarations are then available to be used throughout the entire program. The global execution context is not a tangible object, but rather an abstract concept that represents the space in which code is executed.

The global execution context is the default execution context that is created when a JavaScript program starts running. There is only one global execution context, and declarations made in this context are available throughout the entire program. Variables declared with the `var` keyword are stored in the global lexical environment and are also added as properties of the `window` object in web browsers. Functions declared with the `function` keyword are also stored in the global lexical environment and are added as methods of the `window` object.

<Code language='javascript'>

function greet() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log('Hello, World!');
}

window.greet(); // logs "Hello, World!"
</Code>

In the global execution context, function expressions created with the `var` keyword are stored in the global lexical environment, but are not added as properties of the `window` object in web browsers. Only function declarations are added as properties of the `window` object. To keep the global scope clean and maintainable, it is generally considered a best practice to avoid declaring variables and functions in the global execution context. Instead, it is recommended to declare variables and functions within the appropriate scope, such as within a function or block, or to use `let` or `const` to create function expressions. This helps to prevent pollution of the global scope and makes it easier to keep track of the variables and functions that are available in your program.
