<br/>
Imagine that you are a doctor working in a hospital, and you are responsible for monitoring patients who have undergone surgery. To help you keep track of your patients, you have a set of "records" that you use to keep track of important information about each patient, such as their medical history, treatment plan, and recovery progress.

<br/>
As a doctor, you have a set of "tools" that you can use to monitor and update the patient records as needed. For example, you might use a tool that allows you to monitor a patient's vital signs, or a tool that allows you to track the progress of a patient's recovery.

<br/>
In React, the `useMutationEffect` Hook is similar to the doctor's tools in that it allows you to perform side effects in response to a DOM element being added or removed from the DOM. The `useMutationEffect` Hook is a function that you can use inside a custom component to perform side effects in response to changes in the DOM.

<br/>
For example, consider the following code written in React:

```

  import React, { useMutationEffect } from 'react';

  function Example() {
    useMutationEffect(() => {
      console.log('The component has been added to the DOM');
    }, []);

    return (
      <div>
        Example component
      </div>
    );
  }

```

<br/>
In this code, the `useMutationEffect` Hook is used to perform a side effect when the `Example` component is added to the DOM. The `useMutationEffect` Hook is called with a function that logs a message to the console, and an empty array as the second argument, which indicates that the side effect should only be performed when the component is added to the DOM.

<br/>
When the `Example` component is rendered, the `useMutationEffect` Hook is called, and the function passed as the first argument is executed. In this case, the function logs the message 'The component has been added to the DOM' to the console.

<br/>
Overall, the `useMutationEffect` Hook in React is a function that allows you to perform side effects in response to a DOM element being added or removed from the DOM. It is a useful tool for performing side effects in a React application that involve changes to the DOM.
