_"In JavaScript, prototypes are objects that are used as templates for creating new objects, and they provide a way to share properties and behaviors among objects."_

<br/>
Prototypes in JavaScript can be thought of as a set of instructions for building a model or prototype of a product. When a company wants to create a new product, they often start by building a model or prototype of the product to test and refine the design. The prototype is a working model that represents the final product, but it may be made of different materials or be less refined than the final product.

<br/>
In the same way, prototypes in JavaScript are used as templates for creating new objects. A prototype is an object that represents the final object that you want to create, but it may not have all of the properties or behaviors of the final object. You can use the prototype as a starting point to create new objects that inherit the properties and behaviors of the prototype.

<br/>
For example, consider a "Person" prototype that represents people with properties like name, age, and gender, and behaviors like speaking and walking. You can create a new "Person" object like this:

<Code language='javascript'>

const person = Object.create(Person.prototype);
</Code>

This creates a new object called "person" that has the properties and behaviors specified in the "Person" prototype. You can then use this object to represent a specific person, like "Alice", by setting the object's properties:

<Code language='javascript'>

person.name = "Alice";
person.age = 30;
person.gender = "female";
</Code>

You can also use the object's behaviors, like this:

<Code language='javascript'>

person.speak("Hello, my name is Alice!");
person.walk();
</Code>

In this way, prototypes in JavaScript allow you to create new objects that inherit properties and behaviors from a prototype, and to customize those objects as needed.
